# QTI SDK Test Scripts

## Prerequistes

Make sure you installed QTI SDK using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/). See the main README.md file
at the root of the project for more information about installation.

## Running The Scripts

These multiple scripts aim at testing/understand QTI-SDK. Feel free to open them to see how it works! The following example
illustrates how to run the script demonstrating Wilbert Kraan's Goldilocks + Information Model CSS Mapping on a Choice Interaction.

```shell
php ChoiceInteraction1Rendering.php
```

Explore the code to see which arguments it can ingest!
